# SF Eats (React, Node.js)

This food truck finder allows users to search for any and all food trucks in San Francisco, California. Each food truck that can be searched is from querying through a .json file that contains all food trucks that had or currently have a valid license.

Features:
Search Bar for users to search for a food item, genre, food truck or cart, and a search radius to show food trucks in a certain area from the current location of the user. Each food truck will appear on the left side of the screen with the name and distance from user. The location of the food truck will also appear on the map as a red marker.

The map is a dark mode template from MapBox API.
